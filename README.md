# Swim Distance Tracker

In 2024, I plan to swim at least 100 miles. I wanted to design an app for my personal use, to track how many laps I swim and perform conversions with feet, yards, and miles.

To do:

Advanced button, opens modal to add extra details
- time and temperature (weather API?)
- click on date to fetch those details
- select menu for different pools?
- JSON file with pools and yardage
- total laps
- total miles
- total yards?
